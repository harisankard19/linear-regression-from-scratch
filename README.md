# Linear Regression from Scratch

Implementing a linear regression model from scratch is a strong foundational exercise. It helps you understand how optimization works, especially gradient descent and loss minimization. By manually computing weights, bias, and errors, you internalize the math behind model fitting. This builds intuition for more complex models and gives you full control over every step, which high-level libraries abstract away. It's not for production use but critical for learning.

Usage:

load the Linear_Regression class to colab, then execute:      from Linear_Regression import Linear_Regression
